Data Science-Data Storytelling Portfolio Project

For this Data Storytelling project, I was interested in visualizing the distribution of Bitcoin ATMs across the U.S. and evaluating the possible negative effects of restrictive Bitcoin legislation and its influence on Bitcoin ATM availability

My research question- Did the BitLicense legislation that New York state passed in 2015 have a negative impact on Bitcoin ATM availability in the state?
